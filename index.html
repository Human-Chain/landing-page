      <h2>HumanChain</h2>

      <p>HumanChain is building the infrastructure for AI safety. The guardrail against AI failure. Failure not
      intrinsically as a technology but the context within which it operates, the governance structures it is subject to, the
      networks of power and uses to which it is put.</p>
      <p>The AI era has begun. We are living in a time of immense opportunities and perils. To make the most of it we need to
      create a safe, trustworthy and human-centric digital world. Too few of us are focused on building the future that
      humanity can enjoy without stifling innovation.</p>
      <p>AI seismic wave is not equal to previous technological revolutions that pessimism aversion will suffice due to the
      following reasons: it is inherently general and therefore omniuse, can hyper-evolve, has asymmetric impacts, and is
      increasingly autonomous.</p>
      <p>We are techno-optimists who believe that humanity deserves the abundance and significant societal improvements that AI
      can reap for us. But currently their creation is driven by powerful incentives: geopolitical competition, massive
      financial rewards, and slowly turning into a closed culture of research. State and non-state actors will race ahead to
      develop them, taking risks that affect everyone, whether we like it or not.</p>
      <p>Time is nigh. Join us.</p>
      <p>We are assembling a team of the world's best engineers and researchers dedicated to safe AI diffusion.
